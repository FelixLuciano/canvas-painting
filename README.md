### INTRODUCTION

**canvas-painting** is a base web component with a set of methods available that go straight on the point on creating reusable canvas illustrations.


### FEATURES

**Reusable** - Once your painting is programmed, a simple html attribute can bring thousands of canvas to life, replicating the exact behavior for each one, but with datasets, it is still possible to make individual scope changes.

**Straight to the point** - With the available methods, the only job is to bring the painting to the canvas.

**Stats** - Monitor real-time information of his painting with [Stats](http://mrdoob.github.io/stats.js). By giving the command, the service is automatically embedded in your project.
